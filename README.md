# Cryptographic arena
Project for the MPC-KRY course. The task is to create a capture the flag game using selected topics from cryptography. All tasks are implemented in Python.
## Content
Selected topics from cryptography:
* ElGamal,
* RSA,
* AES,
* Hash,
* CBC-MAC,
* Transposition cipher,
* Steganography.
## Dependencies and setup
* Python 3: sudo apt install python3
* Pip: sudo apt install python3-pip
* Crypto library: pip install pycrypto
* PWN tools: pip install pwntools
* CV2: pip install opencv-python
* NUMPY: pip install numpy
## How to run in console
* Steganography: 
```
python extract.py stegano_encoded_X.png
```
* Others: 
```
python name-of-file.py
```
## Solution
The actual implementation of the tasks is up to each individual. However, there is a solution folder that contains possible solutions to all tasks. The folder is also included in the virtual machine. It must be deleted before deploying to live operation.

## Virtual machine link
The virtual machine is preconfigured and designed for live use. All software and dependencies are already installed. Visual Studio Code is also pre-installed. However, it is possible to clone this repository and run it manually.
